## Notes
- Access Token: A secure string that a client uses to access protected resources. An instance issues access tokens to clients that have a valid authorization grant. Each access token has a specific scope, lifespan, and other attributes.
By default, an instance issues access tokens with a 30-minute lifespan in the scenario where the instance is the OAuth provider. 

- Refresh Token: A credential that a client uses to obtain new access tokens without requiring additional user authorization. An instance issues a refresh token to a client when it is first authorized to have an access token.
By default, an instance issues refresh tokens with a 100-day lifespan in the scenario where the instance is the OAuth provider.
